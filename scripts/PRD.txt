# Overview  
The Snow Drought Index is a Python package designed to analyze and classify snow drought conditions using advanced methodologies and indices. It addresses the need for robust, reproducible, and extensible tools for hydrologists, climate scientists, and water resource managers to assess snow droughts, their impacts, and trends. The package is valuable for research, operational monitoring, and decision support in regions where snowpack is a critical water resource.

# Core Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Gap filling of SWE data using quantile mapping, linear interpolation, and artificial gap evaluation. Data extraction and filtering by geography.
- **Snow Drought Analysis**: Calculation of Standardized Snow Water Equivalent Index (SSWEI), SWE/P ratio analysis, and drought classification (Heldmyer et al. 2022, Huning & AghaKouchak 2020). Elevation-based and basin-based analysis.
- **Visualization**: Time series, spatial, and classification plots for SWE and drought indices. Data availability and performance evaluation visualizations.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Snow Cover Seasonality (SCS) analysis, trend detection, and clustering. Support for case studies and custom workflows.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design with class-based implementations (SWEDataset, SSWEI, DroughtAnalysis), configuration management, and provenance tracking.
- **CLI & API**: Command-line interface for all major workflows, with plans for RESTful API and dashboard integration.

# User Experience  
- **User Personas**: Hydrologists, climate scientists, water managers, researchers, and advanced students.
- **Key User Flows**:
  - Load and preprocess SWE data (NetCDF, HDF5, GeoTIFF, CSV)
  - Fill data gaps and validate results
  - Calculate SSWEI and classify droughts
  - Visualize results and generate reports
  - Run advanced analyses (trend, SCS, clustering)
  - Use CLI for batch processing or integrate into Python workflows
- **UI/UX Considerations**:
  - Clear CLI with help and documentation
  - Consistent function/class interfaces
  - Output visualizations suitable for publication
  - Planned: Interactive dashboards (Dash/Streamlit), automated reporting, and accessibility features

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical Challenges**: Large dataset handling, parallelization, and memory optimization. *Mitigation*: Use chunking, Dask, and memory-efficient algorithms.
- **MVP Definition**: Scope creep from advanced features. *Mitigation*: Strict phase-based roadmap, clear MVP definition.
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited contributors and compute resources. *Mitigation*: Modular design, open-source community, cloud integration.
- **Data Quality**: Incomplete or inconsistent SWE data. *Mitigation*: Robust validation, gap filling, and provenance tracking.
- **Sustainability**: Long-term maintenance and funding. *Mitigation*: Community governance, grant proposals, and partnerships.
